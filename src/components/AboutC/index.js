              My name is Dan Collins, proprietor of Mr. Junkaway. The company
              began in 2017 to fill a niche that seemed promising and fun. After
              40 some years in construction I had found a type of service that
              was in perpetual demand, improved my physical condition and held
              the potential for building a strong family of loyal customers.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[14px] leading-[25px] mb-[15px] lg:max-w-[490px] text-black">
              We feel that the services we provide contribute a little something
              toward improving life quality within the communities we serve.
              That is something we truly enjoy. After 6 years in this business
              our company now receives around 30% of new work orders from
              customers weâ€™ve previously served. We hope you will allow us to
              show you why!
            </p>
