excerpt: I would give Dan 10 stars if possible....Mr. Junkaway is awesome! Connected with him on Monday to clean out our messy garage. He came out at 3 that day and gave me a very reasonable quote.  Completed the job the next day. I was out of town so he provided "after" pictures. It was spotless. I would highly recommend Mr. Junkaway!!
