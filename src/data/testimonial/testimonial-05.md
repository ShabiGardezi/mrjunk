excerpt: My hauling was probably small by their standards being just a ton of cardboard boxes after a move and a few concrete piers. Still, I appreciated that Dan was quick to respond and communicated well. He and Dillon did good work and were pleasant people. Hopefully I won't be finding more to throw away, but if I do, I'll give them a call.
